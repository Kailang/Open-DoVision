Open-DoVision
=============

Open Source Virtual Reality for Everyone

Well, this repository mainly has the source code for the Open DoVision sensor board.
So, most of the files are written in the C language.

Since the implementations of the sensor board are indefinate, different usages will be store in different brenches.
Note that some of the brenches may contain non-C source code for the need of PC demos.

Of cause, unless told elsewhere, all the files are published under GUN GPL V3.0 License.

Enjoy!
