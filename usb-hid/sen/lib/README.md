Open-DoVision
=============

Open Source Virtual Reality for Everyone

**lib** - Libraries

***

###General Descriptions:

Beacuse our sensor board uses the STM32F303 MCU (Micro Controller Unit) , all the sdk wirtten for it are ready to use.


Plus our sensor board is designed to be compatible with the STM32F3DISCOVERY , the ultilities wirtten for that are ready to use as well.

Please see the README.txt otr Release_Notes.html in each file for full documentation on these SDKs.

In order to start developing the other real projects for Open DoVision or your own STM32F3DISCOVERY, you should include:

**lib/CMSIS/Include**

**lib/CMSIS/Device/ST/STM32F30x/Include**

**lib/STM32_USB-FS-Device_Driver/inc**

**lib/STM32F30x_StdPeriph_Driver/inc**

**lib/STM32F3_Discovery**

***

###Folders:

**CMSIS** Cortex Microcontroller Software Interface Standard

**STM32_USB-FS-Device_Driver** STM32F10x, STM32L1xx and STM32F3xx USB-FS-Device Driver
